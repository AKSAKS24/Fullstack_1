# TSD Agent Guidelines

These guidelines provide high‑level instructions for generating each section of the Technical Specification Document (TSD).  Use clear, concise language and adhere to SAP best practices.

* **Tone**: Professional and formal. Avoid colloquialisms.
* **Style**: Use complete sentences for paragraphs. For tables, use column headers and pipe‑delimited rows (e.g., `Header1 | Header2`).
* **Content**: Focus on relevant information extracted from the provided documents and input text. Do not fabricate details.
* **Length**: Be succinct but comprehensive. Each section should be proportional to its importance.
